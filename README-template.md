## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This was a very hard challenge. Through this challenge I learnt about Regular Expression.
Furthermore, updating user real time interaction is fairly hard. Luckily, I managed to use splice() effectively.

Regular Expression can be very powerful if you know how to use them.

### Continued development

Definitely looking into React.js now. I feel like Frontend Mentor Challenges are super interesting to solve. Especially I always have smart people to help me when I get stuck :D
